# copy_big_query_table
A simple script to copy big query table

### NEED

Google's Big Table doesn't support changing column schema. So for that case, even though there are simple functions given by API, there will be difficulty while simply duplicating a table. Until now this is the only thing I have figured out that can do the casting of columns.
